<p>The members of GacktJob have said that You is like a robot, with the exception of Gackt, who says he&#39;s half donkey, half horse.</p>

<p>They celebrated You&#39;s 30th birthday on Gackt&#39;s radio show together; I&#39;ve dedicated a page to it <a href="${"/music-career/birthday-2003"}">here</a> since I had so much info about it.</p>

<p><em>More info coming soon.</em></p>
