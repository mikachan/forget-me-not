ðŸ¤– Live site: [you.sekai.co.uk](https://you.sekai.co.uk/)

This is a fansite for Japanese musician, YOU, best know for playing guitar and violin for Gackt, and more recently, S.Q.F. 

The site was first opened on 23rd March 2004, built with basic HTML and CSS in trusty Notepad. Around 2009 it was rebuilt as a Wordpress site where it lived for another 5-6 years. I then unfortunately completely abdandoned the site until 2020, when it was rebuilt again using Svelte, Sapper and Tailwind.

This was one of my first popular sites, helped along by being built when fansites were a big thing. Nevertheless I was really proud of building and maintaining it, and I'm pleased to have a working version live again after all this time.

YOU will always be my favourite robotic, multi-talented guitarist!
