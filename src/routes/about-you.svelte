		<p><strong>Name:</strong> You (pronounced 'yuu')</p>

		<p><strong>Position in GacktJOB:</strong> Rhythm guitar and violin</p>

		<p><strong>Birthday:</strong> 10th February 1973</p>

		<p><strong>Height:</strong> 186cm (or 6'2")</p>

		<p><strong>From:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_region" target="new">Kansai region</a> of Japan</p>

		<p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> cooking, riding his motorcycle, martial arts, snowboarding, bowling, photography, reading manga</p>

		<h2>Favourites</h2>

		<p><strong>Fragrance</strong>: his favourite fragrance is <a href="http://www.jeanpaul-gaultier.com/" target="new">Jean Paul Gaultier</a>. Gaultier is very sweet. And the men's fragrance smells the same as the women's, in my opinion. Remember that commercial with the guy in a sailor's suit? He walks up to the girl, kisses her and then they turn into perfume bottles Something like that. Well, that's Jean Paul.</p>

		<p><strong>Food</strong>: his favourite food is <a href="http://www.nikibone.com/recipe/japanese/yakiudon.html" target="new">yaki-udon</a> (fried noodles). When Gackt asked why he liked them, he said it was because they lasted for a long time (in your stomach, keeping you full). He's always cooking yaki-udon too.</p>

		<p><strong>Sport</strong>: I gather from everything that Gackt says, You looooves to snowboard. He can do a 360 in the air and probably a lot of other nifty tricks. He also taught Gackt to snowboard. He also likes tennis, bowling and baseball.</p>
