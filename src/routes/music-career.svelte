<h2>Music Career</h2>

<p>You's famous for playing the guitar and violin, of course. He can also play the drums. You has worked on all of Gackt's solo work, playing the guitar and violin.</p>

<p>You has been in all of Gackt's concerts and live house tours, playing rhythm guitar. In certain songs, such as <em>Miz√©rable</em> (The Sixth Day and Seventh Night, 2004) and <em>Juunigatsu no Love Song</em> (Kagen no Tsuki, 2002), he plays the violin instead (since it's impossible to play both at once, ne). Although, since JOB now only has You as the rhythm guitarist, he's nearly always on guitar.</p>

<p>You is also a lyricist. He wrote a song for Chachamaru's album <em>Air</em>, called <em>Metamorphose</em>. The lyrics can be seen <a href="http://www.mognet.net/artisttranslation.php?id=124&amp;translation=english" target="new">here</a>. You also helps with the violin scores for Gackt's compositions. Actually, I'm not sure if he just helps Gackt, or writes all of the violin pieces.</p>

<h3>CAINS:FEEL (1989-1995)</h3>

<p>When Gackt met You he was a guitarist for a band in Kyoto. The band members were known for starting fights at livehouses. I think they were also a visual kei band. I'm pretty sure he would've been able to play the violin at this time too.</p>

<h3>GacktJOB (2000-2018)</h3>
<p>Five years after <a href="/cains-feel/">CAINS:FEEL</a>, Gackt got in touch with You and Ren again to form GacktJOB.</p>

<p>You has been in JOB since the start of Gackt's solo career, first recording in LA in January 1999. He plays the rhythm guitar and violin.</p>

<p>He raps with Yosh in <em>Dybbuk</em>, on Gackt's <em>Crescent</em> album. Him and Yosh take turns, and You starts. He also raps in <em>Redemption</em>, as well as appearing in the promotional video.</p>

<p>The other members of GacktJOB say that You is a robot, with the exception of Gackt, who says he's half donkey, half horse.</p>

<p>This is what You says about the other members of JOB:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gackt: as wide and as deep as the ocean</li>
	<li>Chacha: a very elegant and talented guitarist</li>
	<li>Masa: pretty and sexy, but also like a boy</li>
	<li>Ren: adorable and optimistic, but "yellow"</li>
	<li>Toshi: like a dependable big bro</li>
	<li>Igao: optimistic like the sun</li>
</ul>

<p>The members of GacktJOB celebrated You's 30th birthday on Gackt's radio show; I've dedicated a page to it <a href="/birthday-2003">here</a>.</p>
