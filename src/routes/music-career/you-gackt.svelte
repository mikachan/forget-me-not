<h2>You & Gackt</h2>

<h3>Meeting Gackt</h3>

<p>Gackt has explained how him and You met several times, including in his autobiography in Section 2: Kakusei, Chapter 4: "Hatsu Bando CAIN'S FEEL".</p>

<p>While You was a guitarist for a band in Kyoto, him and his band used to regularly visit a recording studio where Gackt worked as a sound technician. Gackt had seen You's band perform live at a livehouses in Kyoto several times and was fond of one of the guitarists, but he'd never made the connection between this guitarist and You.</p>

<p>He knew of You from when they were in the studio together (roughly every two weeks), however they didn't speak much as Gackt thought You was quite hostile, as he didn't talk a lot and glared at him. He's since found out that the glaring was because You is short-sighted...</p>

<p>One day he asked You who the guitarist he liked was, and You explained it was him. Gackt didn't believe him, going so far as arguing against it! So You took him to his house to show him photos and prove he was the guitarist, and from that point they became good friends. Gackt really liked the contrast between You's on-stage persona, expressive and dramatic, compared to his real personality, quiet and aloof.</p>

<p>Shortly after becoming friends, they formed <a href="/cains-feel">CAINS:FEEL</a>.</p>

<h3>Early Street Performances</h3>

<p>Back when they used to perform on the streets of Kyoto together, they played <em>hanashitaku wa nai</em> (by T-Bolan) at Christmas in Kamogawa, Kyoto. Gackt's girlfriend at the time had left him and so he was alone on Christmas Day. You asked Gackt if he'd sing along to him playing guitar so he was not alone. Gackt refused, however You insisted on playing in the street to keep him company. They recreated the performance on the Happy Xmas Show in 2003, with You on the guitar and Gackt singing.</p>

<h3>Relationship with Gackt</h3>

<p>You has been by Gackt's side for over 20 years, and Gackt has explained endless times how close they are, comparing their relationship to that of a close family member or soulmate. They have an extremely sweet relationship and this is, in part, why You is such a firm fan favourite.</p>

<p>Here's some random quotes from Gackt, either to You or about You. Bare in mind that these "quotes" are translations from Japanese either by myself or others, so they are of course not <em>direct</em> quotations. And as when anything is translated, the intended meaning is often lost. Having said that, most are easy to interpret!</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>"I know what you think... Because You and I are always together, live together, sleep together, you think that we're gay, don't you? Myself, I'd rather say that You is my soulmate. I prefer to say it this way."</em></li>
	<li><em>"I first met him 10 years ago... It's been 10 years already. He rode his big motorbike just like a prince on a white horse, and riding behind, I was the princess."</em></li>
	<li><em>"He really is... amazing."</em></li>
	<li><em>"We ain't gay!"</em></li>
	<li><em>"Well, isn't he cute? See that smile? No one can really blame him."</em></li>
	<li><em>"See, this guy You... Well, he is a very cute person."</em></li>
	<li><em>"He'll say Happy Birthday to me... maybe around 28th of July."</em></li>
	<li><em>(To the fans, as You comes on stage:) "Oh, please! You don't have to get that excited..."</em></li>
	<li><em>"Watch out for his charming, innocent smile, girls."</em></li>
	<li><em>"Isn't he such a good looking guy?"</em></li>
	<li><em>"... I'll always continue to love him."</em></li>
	<li><em>"Even if one day in the future, you cannot see with your eyes, I will be happy to be your eyes! Also, if one day my waist cannot work, you have to be my waist!"</em></li>
	<li><em>"And my oldest friend. My best friend, his name is You!"</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I wonder if Gackt ever says anything bad about You...</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>"Clean the damn toilet from time to time!"</em></li>
</ul>
