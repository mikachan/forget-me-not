<p>The following is from a radio broadcast that was included on a DVD in Gackt&#39;s <em>nine*nine</em> box set. The broadcast was held by Gackt and one of his staff members. They mainly talk about the beginning of Gackt&#39;s solo career in 1999, and Miyavi and Kamijo appear as guests. Later on in the show, around 3am, You calls in and has a short conversation with Gackt.</p>
