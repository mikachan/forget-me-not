<p>You has designed a couple of bracelets with Monkey-act-web. All You-related things could be found under the <em>WithMAD</em> section of the site. The last bracelet on the <Link href="http://www.monkey-act-web.com/you/youpage.html">this page</Link> he designed in 2003.</p>

<p>He also designed a silver earring and a pendant in 2004, also under the WithMAD branding.</p>

<p>You has made comments on the bracelets, saying they were his first collaboration with Monkey, and that it took a long time to design them.</p>

<p>He's also designed other pieces of jewelery for <em>h-Darts</em>, including earrings, bracelets and necklaces. His latest design is a bracelet titled "Earth", which can be seen <Link href="http://www.h-darts.com/original/order/image/g_you_model.jpg">here</Link>.</p>

<p>The best thing from the h-darts collab was this gorgeous but slightly awkward must-show-hands-and-wrists-in-all-shots photoshoot:</p>
