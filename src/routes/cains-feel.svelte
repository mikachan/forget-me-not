<h2>CAINS:FEEL</h2>

<p>You's first successful band was called "CAINS:FEEL". He played the guitar, alongside Gackt as the vocalist. Ren, former bassist of GacktJOB, was also in the band. The band members were known as troublemakers as they often started fights at local venues, mainly between rival bands.</p>

<p>The origin of the name is from Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam and Eve from Genesis in the Old Testament. They formed in 1989, and disbanded in 1995.</p>

<p>Whilst they recorded a lot of songs for the demo tape, they only chose to include the following 3. Other songs were adopted by Gackt later in his solo career (e.g. etude was used on <em>Love Letter</em>).</p>
