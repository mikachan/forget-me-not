<p>Welcome to <strong>Forget-me-not</strong>, a fansite dedicated to the Japanese musician, You, best known for being part of Gackt's band and SQF.</p>

<h2>Latest Updates</h2>

<p><strong>12.12.20</strong><br>
Guess who's back! After over 6 years I've decided to rebuild this fansite. I've restored most of the content but not many images yet, and I'm guessing loads of the information is now incorrect or wildy out of date. But it's back and I'd forgotten how much I enjoy fangirling over You!</p>

<h2>Site History</h2>

<p>The site was first opened on 23rd March, 2004. I decided to make a You fan site because, at the time, there were no sites dedicated to him in English.</p>

<p>The name <em>forget-me-not</em> was chosen after looking through my Japanese dictionary. It was originally called <em>Silence and Motion</em> after the Final Fantasy VIII track of the same name. I was listening to <em>Wasurenai kara</em> all day, and when I looked up the word "forget" in my dictionary I came across "forget-me-not".</p>

<p><a href="/thanks">Thank you</a> to everyone who helped make this site possible.</p>
