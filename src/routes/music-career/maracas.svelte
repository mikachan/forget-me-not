<h2>Maracas</h2>

<p>In 1996, Malice Mizer organised a series of events to celebrate their 4th anniversary, called <em>喜劇の晩餐~VISUAL ART COLLECTION VOL.1~</em>, made up of performances by cover bands each band member had put together. The first event was held on 8th November 1996 at Shibuya <em>ON AIR WEST</em>, a small venue that holds about 600 people. It was reviewed in <em>Fool's Mate 02.1997</em>, which is where the photo is from.</p>

<p>Gackt described the cover band he put together in the Malice Mizer fanclub magazine <em>Ma chérie</em> (vol. 2&3). He first called <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschera_(band)">Maschera</Link>, another visual kei band that were active at the time, who were excited to perform with him. He then called You and invited him to perform as well, "We spent 2-3 hours on the phone discussing details, chose the songs to perform and arranged a meeting."</p>

<p>The final line-up included Gackt, You, all of Maschera (Michi on vocals, Takuya on guitar, Hiro on bass, Tomo on drums) and Makoto (another old friend of Gackt's).</p>
