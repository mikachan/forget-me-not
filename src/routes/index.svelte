<h2>Site History</h2>

<p>The site was first opened on 23rd March, 2004. I decided to make a You fan site because, at the time, there were no sites dedicated to him in English. I know on just about every Gackt site there's a section on JOB, but I have grown to love You just as much as I love Gackt. Although I probably won't get any more information than any other site, I still wanted to dedicate this to You.</p>

<p>I called it "Forget-me-Not" after looking through my Japanese dictionary. It was originally called "Silence and Motion" after the Final Fantasy VIII track, "Silence and Motion". I was listening to Wasurenai kara all day, and when I looked up the word "forget" in my dictionary I came across "forget-me-not".</p>
