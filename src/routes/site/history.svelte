<h2>Site History</h2>

<p>The site was first opened on 23rd March, 2004. I decided to make a You fan site because, at the time, there were no sites dedicated to him in English.</p>

<p>The site was named after the Gackt song, <em>Wasurenai kara</em> (忘れないから, 'I won't forget'). It was originally called <em>Silence and Motion</em> after the Final Fantasy VIII track of the same name.</p>

<p>You can view the site source on <a href="https://github.com/mikachan/forget-me-not" target="_blank">GitHub here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="site/thanks">Thank you</a> to everyone who helped make this site possible over the years.</p>
