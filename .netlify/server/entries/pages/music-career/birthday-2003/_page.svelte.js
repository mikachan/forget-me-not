(O___O)<br><br> <b data-svelte-h="svelte-bu3syi">Gackt</b>: ^_____^ But the best thing... was your smile when you understood that it was only a joke. ^^ It was perfect...

I wanted him to open up every now and then... and I prepared everything very careful... because he’s always with me he would have noticed something... so it was very difficult... Even Chacha and the others didn’t know... ^^ I just told the staff members right before the program started so that there would be no problem! ^_^ It was good!<br><br> <b data-svelte-h="svelte-1nx5y1b">You</b>: --____-- Sniff~<br><br> <b data-svelte-h="svelte-bu3syi">Gackt</b>: ~^_______^ But you can’t imagine the way he laughed when he understood everything!  =^_^= It’s...  hmm... the best thing in the world...
