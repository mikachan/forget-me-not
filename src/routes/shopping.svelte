There are several places you can buy Gackt releases online. <br>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.yesasia.com/" target="new">YesAsia</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/" target="new">CD Japan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/" target="new">Amazon Japan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.hmv.co.jp/" target="new">HMV Japan</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.jlist.com/" target="new">JList</a></li>
</ul>

My personal favourite is YesAsia and I would recommend them to anyone, anywhere in the world. I have used CD Japan before, however the package took nearly three months to arrive (they had it in stock) and I had to pay extra shipping costs when I received it from the post office. Although, this may have been a one-off. I would use them again with caution. The online experience is fine! They also stock items that you may not find elsewhere.<br><br>

I do not recommend eBay for Gackt purchases, as there are many bootlegs around. This is certainly the place to find a bargain, though. Just be careful what you're spending your money on. The general rule for spotting unlicensed Gackt products is anything produced by <a href="http://miyacd.com/" target="new">Miya Records</a>. They often seem (and sometimes are) high-quality, however if the <i>Dears</i> or <i>Nippon Crown</i> logos are not present then it's likely they're a bootleg.<br><br>

Late 2007, some Gackt releases became available in America and Europe. If you can, try to buy products from a more local source rather than importing. This encourages the record companies to sell stuff overseas! If you prefer to download, Gackt's music is also available through iTunes.<br><br>

<h3>Recommendations</h3><br>

I strongly encourage you to buy any and all of Gackt's work that you enjoy. Although, not everyone can afford to buy all of his work and therefore you may be a bit choosey. I cannot recommend any of Gackt's albums, photobooks or DVDs enough. <i>However</i>, there are several products that may satisfy the inner You fan more than others. ~_^<br><br>

<u>Albums</u><br><br>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://global.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/aid-10221/section-music/code-j/version-all/did-20/pid-1001834147/" target="new">MOON</a> - Gackt's third solo album. There are images of You in the CD booklet.</li>
	<li><a href="http://global.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/aid-10221/section-music/code-j/version-all/pid-1003257318/" target="new">The Seventh Night</a> - Gackt's 'unplugged' album. Wonderful pictures of You and Gackt in the chunky booklet that comes with the CD.</li>
</ul><br>

<u>DVDs</u><br><br>

Of course, You appears in all of the concert DVDs so I can't really single one out. Although, there's a special place in my heart for <a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=CRBP-10011" target="new">Kagen no Tsuki</a> and <a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=CRBP-10020" target="new">The Sixth Day and Seventh Night</a>. I believe these are the best concerts so far, so if you can't decide which concert to buy, I recommend these two! Of course, if you're keeping up-to-date with Gackt's new releases, you might enjoy his latest concerts more than these.<br><br>

You also appears in a video on <a href="http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=CRVP-10006" target="new">Soyokaze</a>, however this is a VHS (NTSC).<br><br>

Don't forget <a href="http://global.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/aid-10221/section-videos/code-j/version-all/pid-1003610281/" target="new">Moon Child</a>!<br><br>

<u>Photobooks</u><br><br>

I'm not a big fan of photobooks myself, however I couldn't resist buying a Gackt photobook. I now own four. =_= I always think they're too expensive just for a load of pictures, but when I look through them I do enjoy it and I certainly don't regret buying them. If there's a certain Gackt era you enjoy, do some research on any books he released around that time and get a photobook. ^^<br><br>

You appears in the following books. Hopefully you could track some down. I suppose I recommend eBay. XD Good luck!<br><br>

<ul>
	<li>Mizerable ~Unmei~ photobook</li>
	<li>For Dears</li>
	<li>Jougen no Tsuki Tour Book</li>
	<li>The Air Moon (The Crescent side)</li>
	<li>The Gift ï¿½ The Sixth Day & Seventh Night Tour Book</li>
	<li>Gackt File 1999-2004</li>
	<li>DIABOLOS tour book</li>
</ul>

<u>Platinum Box Sets</u><br><br>

These are very expensive pieces of merchandise! Make sure you definately <i>want</i> it before buying it. They are certainly very nice box sets and are beautifully packaged, but they are just a DVD and a special gift (e.g. a clock). I love them and have every one of them, but I don't think they're worth the cost. However, that's the price you pay for stuff like this, eh? ^^; There are loads of bootleg versions floating around, so if you find one for below ï¿½20/$30 ish on eBay, then it may not be the real thing. However, most are still available on YesAsia and CD Japan.<br><br>
