<p>Gackt&#39;s well known for making a big deal out of staff members&#39; birthdays, usually involving pranks and cake. I decided, since I seem to have so much information on You&#39;s birthday from 2003, why not make a seperate page for it? Yup.</p>

<h3>Where, when, who?</h3>

<p><strong>Where?</strong> - Gackt&#39;s All Night Nippon radio show<br>
	<strong>When?</strong> - February 10th, 2003<br>
	<strong>Who?</strong> - All of GacktJOB and crew
</p>

<h3>Translation</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s a translation from the radio show, sent to me by Sei-chan.</p>

<b>Gackt</b>: ^__^ Today it\u2019s YOU&#39;S birthday!! That\u2019s why we made a program especially for him, it\u2019s dedicated to love!! So, phone us and tell us directly your love-problems... You and I will answer!!<br><br>

*Everything went normal and calm until this last girl phoned...*<br><br>

<b>Girl</b>: -__- Hi... you see, I\u2019ve got a big problem... I went out with a boy, and he was nice and everything... but when he drank he changed entirely, he got violent and uncontrollable, he pushed me and made me do things that you can\u2019t even imagine...<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: O_O That\u2019s terrible! *everybody in the studio : O_O!*<br><br>

<b>Girl</b>: Yes... well... but... but this boy I\u2019m talking about... is a member of your band...<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: O____O WHAT DID YOU SAY?<br> 
*Chacha&amp;You = O___________O!*<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: O_o Bu... But... Who do you mean...?<br><br>

<b>Girl</b>: -_-....he plays guitar...<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: *looks over to You and Chacha* O_O b...but... this can\u2019t be anybody else but...<br><br>

<b>Chacha</b>: O_o Don\u2019t look at me...<br><br>

<b>You</b>: O_o But... But it\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE that it\u2019s ME !! ~~you know it...~~<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: We will see my pretty one... Describe him...<br><br>

<b>Girl</b>: He is very tall... and we met after a concert...<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: O___o You say he\u2019s very tall? So it can only be You... O__O *Gackt looks over to You seriously*<br><br>

<b>You</b>:  WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?? SHE\u2019S LYING!! It\u2019s ... it\u2019s totally IMPOSSIBLE!!~ no no nooo!!<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b> (stressed): ... we will see... what you say is enormous... you can\u2019t phone and say this if you can\u2019t prove 
it... so we\u2019ll see... right now we are writing a new song for our next album, and nobody knows it so far... of course only the members of my band... but if it\u2019s true what you said about You, you should know this song, don\u2019t you?<br><br>

<b>You</b>:  NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOO I REALLY don\u2019t know her  O_O Gakuchan!! Believe meeee~~O_O she\u2019s lying she\u2019s 
lying she\u2019s LYING IT\u2019S WRONG!! I don\u2019t know her!! *nearly dying*<br><br>

<b>The girl, totally self-confident</b>: Of course I know this song...<br><br>

<b>You</b>: ... But this isn\u2019t RIGHT! Gaaaackt!! believe meeeeee!! She\u2019s a liar! Don\u2019t believe her! 
I don\u2019t know who she is! It\u2019s impossible!! IMPOSSIBLE!! NOOO!!<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: Very well.  Sing this song...<br><br>

And the girl begins to sing....... HAAAAPPY BITHDAAAAAY YOUUUUUUUUUU!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAAAAAAY YOUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!<br><br>

So a lot of people and all of the staff arrive in the room with a cake and sing Happy Birthday for You. ^o^<br><br>

<b>You</b>: (O_____O) *still shocked*<br><br>

And the studio was full of people who sang for him ~ And You was still trembling all over~<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: ^^ This was my gift for your birthday, did you like it?<br><br>

<b>You</b>: (O____O) huh... yes?<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: ^^ I just wanted to watch your face in a situation like this... ^^ It was so funny! ^o^<br><br>

<b>You</b>: ... (O___O)<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: ^_____^ But the best thing... was your smile when you understood that it was only a joke. ^^ It was perfect... Like I thought it would be. ^o^<br><br>

<b>You</b>: --_____-- why meeeeee?!<br><br> 

<b>Gackt</b> (to the audience): Well... so this was my surprise for You... I wanted him to open up every now and then... and I prepared everything very careful... because he\u2019s always with me he would have noticed something... so it was very difficult... Even Chacha and the others didn\u2019t know... ^^ I just told the staff members right before the program started so that there would be no problem! ^_^ It was good!<br><br> 

<b>You</b>: --____-- Sniff~<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: ~^_______^ But you can\u2019t imagine the way he laughed when he understood everything!  =^_^= It\u2019s...  hmm... the best thing in the world... I work only to see it!!<br><br> 

<b>You</b>:  ah really?<br><br>

<b>Gackt</b>: ^_^ Well... I know that it was a bit of a risk as well because I had no idea how You would react... ^^ But well...<br><br> 

<b>You</b>: ^_^ you are very nice, thank you.... Hmmm...<br><br>
