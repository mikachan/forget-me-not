Etude


Lost words, searching with my head down
I don't know when, but I've made you a memory
I don't know the reason why I'm crying
As if I'm hiding away my sadness
Nothing is changing again, from what I can see with my eyes

Only you

As if the word that dissappeared at the end
Stayed inside my heart
And brought my feelings to you
Sadness, together with a melody

Even the shadow that looked down on me
Has turned into a memory
I want to hear the last words once more
Embrace the laughed times rather
Than the sad ones

As if the word that dissappeared at the end
Stayed inside my heart
And brought my feelings to you
Sadness, together with an etude

As if the word that dissappeared at the end
Stayed inside my heart
And brought my feelings to you
Sadness, together with a melody

If I still had the nerve, I could be nicer
Bring my feelings to you
Sadness, together with a melody
Bring my feelings to you
Love, together with an etude
