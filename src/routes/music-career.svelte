<h2>Music Career</h2>

<p>You's best known for playing the guitar and violin, but can also play drums and piano. At live shows he usually plays rhythm guitar and sometimes violin.</p>

<p>You also wrote a song for Chachamaru's album <em>Air</em>, called <em>Metamorphose</em>.</p>

<h3>Pre-1989</h3>

<p>You was a guitarist for a couple of different bands in Kyoto when he first started his music career. Originally, it seems that when he was younger he didn't have many ambitions for being successful outside of Kyoto, and it was Gackt who eventually persuaded him to join him in Tokyo to further his music career.</p>

<h3>CAINS:FEEL (1989-1995) <a href="/cains-feel" class="text-sm">read more &rarr;</a></h3>

<p>CAINS:FEEL was a Japanese rock/goth band, formed by You and Gackt, and was their first band together.</p>

<p>You met Gackt whilst he was working as a guitarist for another band. Gackt was working as a sound technician in the same studio that You's band used for recordings. Eventually, they became good friends and decided to start a band together.</p>

<p>At the time, Gackt was a drummer and You was only playing guitar. They couldn't decide who should do vocals and You jokingly suggested that Gackt should do it. After a couple of arguments and proving each other wrong, Gackt agreed to be the vocalist and took singing lessons. It's fair to say that if it wasn't for You, Gackt perhaps wouldn't have even considered being a lead vocalist.</p>

<h3>GacktJOB (1999-2019) <a href="/gacktjob" class="text-sm">read more &rarr;</a></h3>
<p>During the time between CAINS:FEEL and GacktJOB, You and Gackt kept in contact over the phone. After four years, Gackt called You up to ask him to join his band as part of his solo career. You was still living in Kyoto at the time, whilst Gackt had already moved to Tokyo to start his solo career. You didn't hesitate to join him, and moved to Tokyo soon after. It was around this time that he learnt how to play violin and piano, on Gackt's recommendation.</p>

<p>You has been in JOB from the beginning of Gackt's solo career, first recording in LA in January 1999.</p>

<p>Alongside guitar and violin, he also raps on <em>Dybbuk</em>, from Gackt's <em>Crescent</em> album, and on <em>Redemption</em> from the <em>Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII</em> soundtrack.</p>

<p>You last performed live with Gackt in 2019 (as part of the Garden de Tobina Festival), and since 2020 Gackt has a new band at live shows. You still attends as JOB 'alumni' though!</p>

<h3>YELLOW FRIED CHICKENz (2010-2012)</h3>

<p>YELLOW FRIED CHICKENz (also known as "YFC" or "YFCz") began as a project by Gackt to express "the cowardice in men's souls", or as an attempt to 'form' men's spirit (don't ask me to explain, all sounds very ~~Gackt~). They released one studio album, one 'best of' album, a couple of singles, a live album from their first European tour and a couple of DVDs.</p>

<p>A highlight during YFC's time was their two European tours, where they performed at sold out venues in London, Paris, Barcelona, Munich, Bochum, Cologne, Amsterdam, Berlin, Budapest, Warszawa, Leipzig, Stockholm and Moscow.</p>

<h3>S.Q.F (2017-present)</h3>

<p>S.Q.F is a Japanese band formed in 2000 by ex-MASCHERA vocalist michi. and was originally michi.'s solo project, with ex-iLLUMINA guitarist, Nao. The name S.Q.F stands for "Spinning Q Factor."</p>

<p>You has been a support band member since 2017, playing guitar at their live shows and on studio recordings.</p>
