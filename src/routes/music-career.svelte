<h2>Music Career</h2>

<p>You's best known for playing the guitar and violin, but can also play drums.</p>

<p>At live shows he usually plays guitar, and less often violin. You can see him playing violin live in Gackt's <em>Miz√©rable</em> (The Sixth Day and Seventh Night, 2004) and <em>Juunigatsu no Love Song</em> (Kagen no Tsuki, 2002).</p>

<p>You is also a lyricist. He wrote a song for Chachamaru's album <em>Air</em>, called <em>Metamorphose</em>. The lyrics can be seen <a href="http://www.mognet.net/artisttranslation.php?id=124&amp;translation=english" target="new">here</a>.</p>

<h3>CAINS:FEEL (1989-1995)</h3>

<p>You was a guitarist for a band in Kyoto when he first met Gackt. The band members were known as troublemakers as they often started fights at local venues, mainly between rival bands.</p>

<h3>GacktJOB (2000-2018)</h3>
<p>Five years after <a href="/cains-feel/">CAINS:FEEL</a>, Gackt got in touch with You and Ren again to form GacktJOB.</p>

<p>You was in JOB since the start of Gackt's solo career, first recording in LA in January 1999. He played rhythm guitar and violin.</p>

<p>He raps with Yosh in <em>Dybbuk</em>, on Gackt's <em>Crescent</em> album. Him and Yosh take turns, and You starts. He also raps in <em>Redemption</em>, as well as appearing in the promotional video.</p>

<p>The other members of GacktJOB say that You is a robot, with the exception of Gackt, who says he's half donkey, half horse.</p>

<p>This is what You says about the other members of JOB:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Chacha: a very elegant and talented guitarist</li>
	<li>Masa: pretty and sexy, but also like a boy</li>
	<li>Ren: adorable and optimistic, but "yellow"</li>
	<li>Toshi: like a dependable big bro</li>
	<li>Igao: optimistic like the sun</li>
</ul>

<p>The members of GacktJOB celebrated You's 30th birthday on Gackt's radio show; I've dedicated a page to it <a href="/birthday-2003">here</a> since I had so much info about it.</p>
